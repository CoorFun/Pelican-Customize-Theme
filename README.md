# Pelican-Customize-Theme

I made this Pelican theme specially for my own [Blog](coorfun.com). If you want to use or modify, do not be hestitated to fork to your repository.

# Features (Planning)
- Extreme simple and clean theme
- Support profile photo
- Support Disque comment
- Duel navigation bars

### Social icons 
Set your configuration in the **pelicanconfig.py** file.

Please note that all the social media name must be in lower case.

An example: 

    SOCIAL = 
    (('github', 'https://github.com/xxx/'),
    ('weibo', 'http://weibo.com/xxx/'),
    ('instagram', 'https://www.instagram.com/xxx/'))
